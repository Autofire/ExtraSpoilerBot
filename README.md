If you just clone this and run it, it will not work. You first need to sed up
all the node dependencies (I'll have to research this), and then you'll also
need an auth.json file with a working bot code.

No, I'm not giving you one for obvious reasons. You'll have to make your own
Discord bot, get your own auth key, and then put that in your auth.json.

The auth.json should look like this:

```
{
"token": "0123456679...1093409458"
}
```
